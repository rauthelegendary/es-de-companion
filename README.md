## 🚀 Installation

1. Download the latest APK from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Install on your device
3. Launch the app and follow the Quick Setup wizard
4. Grant storage permissions when prompted
5. Enable scripts in ES-DE:
   - Open ES-DE
   - Press START → Other Settings
   - Toggle ON "Custom Event Scripts"
   - Toggle ON "Browsing Custom Events"

## 🏠 Recommended Setup

For the best experience, use [Mjolnir](https://github.com/blacksheepmvp/mjolnir) to run this companion app together with ES-DE as your home screens on dual-display devices.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### File Paths

The app uses these default paths (configurable in settings):

| Path | Default Location | Purpose |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| **Downloaded Media** | `/storage/emulated/0/ES-DE/downloaded_media` | Game artwork - fanart, screenshots, marquees, Game videos |
| **System Images** | `/storage/emulated/0/ES-DE/downloaded_media/system_images` | Custom system images (optional override) |
| **System Logos** | `/storage/emulated/0/ES-DE/downloaded_media/system_logos` | Custom system logos (optional override) |
| **Scripts** | `/storage/emulated/0/ES-DE/scripts` | Integration scripts |
| **Logs** | `/storage/emulated/0/ES-DE Companion/logs` | Event log files |

**Note**: Scripts and logs have moved to internal storage (`/ES-DE Companion/`) for better compatibility with SD card installations.

### Custom System Images (Optional Override)

To override random game artwork in system view with your own images:
1. Place custom images in the system images folder
2. Use filenames matching ES-DE system shortnames: `snes.webp`, `arcade.png`, `psx.jpg`, etc.
3. These will override the random game art displayed

### Custom System Logos (Optional Override)

To add additional system logos or override built-in system logos in system view with your own images:
1. Place custom images in the system logos folder
2. Use filenames matching ES-DE system shortnames: `snes.svg`, `snes.png`, `arcade.webp`, etc.
3. These will take priority over built-in logos

## 🎨 How It Works

1. **ES-DE Integration**: The app creates custom event scripts that ES-DE calls when you browse games/systems, launch games, and activate screensavers
2. **Real-time Updates**: Scripts write to log files that the app monitors using FileObserver
3. **Image Loading**: The app reads game metadata and displays corresponding artwork
4. **Smart State Management**: Automatically handles gameplay, screensavers, and browsing states

### Script Files

The Quick Setup creates these scripts automatically:

```
