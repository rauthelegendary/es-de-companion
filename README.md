- **Storage permissions** for accessing media and creating scripts

## 🚀 Installation

1. Download the latest APK from [Releases](../../releases)
2. Install on your device
3. Launch the app and follow the Quick Setup wizard
4. Grant storage permissions when prompted
5. Enable scripts in ES-DE:
   - Open ES-DE
   - Press START → Other Settings
   - Toggle ON "Custom Event Scripts"
   - Toggle ON "Browsing Custom Events"

## 🏠 Recommended Setup

For the best experience, use [Mjolnir](https://github.com/blacksheepmvp/mjolnir) to run this companion app together with ES-DE as your home screens on dual-display devices.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Default Settings
- **Animation Style**: Scale + Fade
- **Background Dimming**: 25%
- **Drawer Opacity**: 70%
- **Background Priority**: Fanart
- **Grid Columns**: 4

All settings can be customized in the Settings screen.

### File Paths

The app uses these default paths (configurable in settings):

| Path | Default Location | Purpose |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| **Downloaded Media** | `/storage/emulated/0/ES-DE/downloaded_media` | Game artwork - fanart, screenshots, marquees |
| **System Images** | `/storage/emulated/0/ES-DE/downloaded_media/systems` | Custom system images (optional) |
| **Scripts** | `/storage/emulated/0/ES-DE/scripts` | Integration scripts |

### System Images (Optional)

Place custom system images in the system images folder with filenames matching ES-DE system shortnames:
- `snes.png` - Super Nintendo
- `arcade.png` - Arcade
- `psx.png` - PlayStation
- etc.

If a system image isn't found, the app displays a random game from that system instead.

## 🎨 How It Works

1. **ES-DE Integration**: The app creates custom event scripts that ES-DE calls when you browse games/systems
2. **Real-time Updates**: Scripts write to log files that the app monitors using FileObserver
3. **Image Loading**: The app reads game metadata and displays corresponding artwork

### Script Files

The Quick Setup creates these scripts automatically:

```
ES-DE/scripts/
├── game-select/
│   └── game-select.sh       # Triggered when browsing games
└── system-select/
    └── system-select.sh     # Triggered when browsing systems
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **Min SDK**: 29 (Android 10)
- **Target SDK**: 34 (Android 14)
- **Architecture**: Single Activity with BottomSheet app drawer
- **Image Loading**: Glide with caching
- **File Monitoring**: FileObserver for real-time updates
