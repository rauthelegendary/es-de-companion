### Game Launch Display Control

  - **Black**: Plain black screen during gameplay (minimal distraction)
  - **Default Image**: Fallback background with current game marquee
  - **Game Image**: Shows launched game's artwork and marquee
- **Dual video blocking system** prevents videos during gameplay:
  - Window focus detection (when ES-DE uses 'launch games on the other screen')
  - Game state tracking (when game launches on top of ES-DE)
- **Smart duplicate filtering** prevents event spam from running games
- **Live setting updates** - Changes apply immediately if game is already running

### Screensaver Display Control
- **New Setting**: "Screensaver Display" in Application Behavior settings
  - **Black**: Plain black screen during screensaver
  - **Default Image**: Fallback background with current marquee
  - **Game Image**: Shows screensaver game artwork (slideshow/video modes)
- **Intelligent screensaver handling**:
  - Automatically detects ES-DE screensaver type (dim/black vs. slideshow/video)
  - Blocks videos during screensaver regardless of mode
  - Ignores browse events during screensaver to prevent interference
- **Live setting updates** - Changes apply immediately if screensaver is active

### 📁 Path Changes (Important!)
