### Game Launch Display Control

  - **Black**: Plain black screen during gameplay (minimal distraction)
  - **Default Image**: Fallback background with current game marquee
  - **Game Image**: Shows launched game's artwork and marquee

  - Game state tracking (when game launches on top of ES-DE)
- **Smart duplicate filtering** prevents event spam from running games
- **Live setting updates** - Changes apply immediately if game is already running

### Screensaver Display Control
- **New Setting**: "Screensaver Display" in Application Behavior settings
  - **Black**: Plain black screen during screensaver
  - **Default Image**: Fallback background with current marquee
